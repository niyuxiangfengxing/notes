# Class 1

data type as object - That's why python doesn't need to explictly state the data type when declaration. 

## python features

1. interpreted language(python) <-> compiled language(JAVA)

   if we want to run the same java program, we need the name JAVA Virtual Machine in different machines.

2. Dynamically typed language, there is no data declaration but only data definition, which results in no data type memory used. 

3. And there are primitive data type, abstract data type and derived data type. 

4. indentation instead braces

5. several sequence types

   - string
   - list: mutable
   - tuple: immutable

6. powerful subcripting(slicing)

7. functions are independent entities 

8. exceptions as in Java

   all are implemented by some predinfe class in python

9. simple object system

10. ["pythonic"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean)

    > Pythonic means code that doesn't just get the syntax right but that follows the conventions of the Python community and uses the language in the way it is intended to be used.
